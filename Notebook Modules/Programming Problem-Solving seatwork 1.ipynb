    "# Programming Problem-Solving seatwork 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student Reminders:**\n",
    "1. Master all logical functions and syntaxes discussed in class:  \n",
    "> - `if`, `elif`, `else`  \n",
    "> - `while`, `for`, `range()`  \n",
    "> - Boolean logic: `and`, `or`, `not`  \n",
    "> - Input handling: `input()`, `int()`, `float()`, `try-except`  \n",
    "> - Match-case (Python 3.10+)  \n",
    "> - Lists and string operations where applicable  \n",
    "2. DO NOT USE AI TOOLS such as **ChatGPT**, **Bard**, or **Copilot** during the seatwork.  \n",
    "> - This seatwork is meant to sharpen your logic and independence.  \n",
    "3. Practice writing code without auto-complete or templates. Stick to raw logic using your notes and exercises.  \n",
    "4. Problems will be situational — like validation systems, conditional flows, menu-driven logic, or loop-controlled tasks. Expect at least one problem involving nested logic.  \n",
    "5. Review the following problem types:  \n",
    "> - Grade evaluators with retries  \n",
    "> - Password/PIN validators  \n",
    "> - Menu command systems  \n",
    "> - Work schedulers  \n",
    "> - FizzBuzz with counters  \n",
    "> - Input series analyzers with conditions  \n",
